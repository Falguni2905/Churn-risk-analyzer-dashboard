## 📈 Key Business KPIs

| Metric                 | Value       |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🔢 Total Customers      | 5,901       |
| 📉 Churn Rate           | 15.49%      |
| 💸 Avg. Monthly Charges | ₹64.76      |
| 🚨 High-Risk Customers  | 1,406       |

---

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard

- 🔁 **Monthly contract customers churn 3× more** than long-term users  
- 💸 Customers paying ₹80+ monthly have higher churn probability  
- 👵 Senior customers + poor support = higher exit rates  
- 🌐 Fiber users without security are at greater churn risk  
- 📉 Around **64% of customers fall under churn risk segments**

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Integration

Used **Logistic Regression** to classify churn probability for each customer. Risk was segmented into:
- **High Risk**
- **Medium Risk**
- **Low Risk**

Integrated model output into Power BI for interactive filtering and business storytelling.
